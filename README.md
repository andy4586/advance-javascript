# Advanced JavaScript – Events & Asynchronous JavaScript

Welcome to my Advanced JavaScript repository! 🚀  
This repository contains my practice and mini-projects focused on understanding **DOM Events**, **Event Listeners**, and **Asynchronous JavaScript**
including concepts like **setTimeout**, **setInterval**, and **Promises**.
